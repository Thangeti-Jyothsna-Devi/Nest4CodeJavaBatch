Day 3: Solve the Printing Mistakes

▪ Due to the printing mistakes, few character in words are exchanged
and we need to fix with the help of program.
▪ Write a program which takes two string as input and exchange the
first two character of one string with last two character of the other
string. Same thing needs to be done for both the string.
▪ Use of loop is not allowed.
▪ You can assume the length of both the input string will be at least 4.
▪ Output strings should be stored in variable before printing.
